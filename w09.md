# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [IBM100 - The Floppy Disk](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/floppy/)<br>
You could learn about floppy disk history here. Make sure to read the other parts, it's interesting. I haven't used it at all and I probably never used it (because it's thrown away and devices don't use that anymore). But it's historical significance and how it became a symbol that everyone knew the function, it's to save.

2. [Compact Disk](https://www.britannica.com/technology/compact-disc)<br>
This is a page about Compact Disk from Britannica. This also have an illustration about how CDs work. It involves laser (cool right?) that read around the shinny part, those "scratch" (but not really scratch) in the disk are what being read by the laser.

3. [Why the Future of Data Storage is (Still) Magnetic Tape](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/why-the-future-of-data-storage-is-still-magnetic-tape)<br>
This is an article about how Tape still survive due to cheap cost and improvements over time. It's cool and I didn't expect it to survive because it's cheap and my logic thought that cheap stuffs often broke and also the information stored in there is not so efficient. But due to its endurance and low data loss overtime, the Tape survived.

4. [SSD vs HDD: What's the difference](https://sea.pcmag.com/storage/1526/ssd-vs-hdd-whats-the-difference)<br>
This page tells you the differences between Solid State Drive and Hard Disk Drive. Solid State Drive might have great capacity to size ratio and write/read speed is higher, but SSDs are more expensive (obviously). Also, there are high end HDDs that could rival it.

5. [How Do SSDs Work?](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/210492-extremetech-explains-how-do-ssds-work)<br>
This page gives you info about how SSDs work. It's interesting, I have seen how HDDs work but I haven't seen how SSDs work before. It involves around floating gates in the NAND gates. Because of being "Solid", it could read and write data at higher speed than the HDDs.

6. [Redundant Array of Independent Disks](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2595506/redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks.html)<br>
This page tells you about RAID and how it protects the data stored in disks. It even has 3 common levels of RAID to pick. Usually, RAID spread the data across the disks in order to reduce the chance of losing the entire data on one part. This usually used in servers.

7. [UEFI and How Is It Different from BIOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uefiunified-extensible-firmware-interface-and-how-is-it-different-from-bios/)<br>
This page tells you about UEFI and its advantages from BIOS. I have heard about these words back when I tried to install linux on my laptop. MBR is sort of the older partition scheme and new PCs use UEFI instead.

8. [What is GRUB?](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-grub/)<br>
This page tells you about GRUB and how it works. GRUB always be found on PCs that contain Linux os. It helps the pc boot to Linux.

9. [What is Systemd?](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/what-is-systemd/)<br>
This page tells you about Systemd and how it works. Basically, systemd preps the linux os to be run and used by their users. They have few units like service unit, mount unit, socket unit, and slice unit. Those units are used to make everything in linux os work.

10. [What is Systemctl?](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-systemctl-an-in-depth-overview/)<br>
This page tells you about Systemctl and how it works. I only use it to start, restart, and stop programs tho.
