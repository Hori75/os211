# TIPS for Class OS212

1. If you aren't familiar with Linux and using terminal, ask a friend who's familiar with it for help.<br>
A friend could help you in teaching you on how to install and use it.

2. About asking for help.<br>
Asking your friends too much could be annoying and distracting. If you have a technical problem, try to 
search about the problem. If you know the reason from the problem, try to solve it (by searching more). 
If you have searched enough and haven't solved the problem, you could ask your friends then. 
But if your friends don't know how to solve either, try asking other friends or teaching assistant (by forum, etc).

3. Verify your work when you are done.<br>
Verifying your work after you have done it could save a lot of time. You could have verify each steps to 
be safe. But, at least, verify your work when you are done. Ignoring this could result in few points loss.

4. Back up your work.<br>
Do you want to do it all over from the start (point 0) when you lost it?  Come on. At least back up when you doing 
something you don't familiar with and could messed up pretty quickly. Just, quicksave (back up), alright?

5. Treat "Top 10" well.<br>
Or not, it will bite your scores. "Bonus" from Top 10 might have big impact on score.

6. You want to learn or not, it's your decision.<br>
You could pass without learning. But, don't you want to learn? At least you have learned something in the end.

7. No begging.<br>
Beggars can't be chooser's. So don't beg.

8. Don't be a deadliner.<br>
If you late, you got nothing after what you've done. So don't be a deadliner.

9. Be smart and quick on quiz.<br>
Want to brag that you are good at Operating System? Find the answers quickly and correctly.

10. Be grateful.<br>
Be grateful that you still given a chance to learn.
